## When you start the program it will ask you to choose from 5 options.

**Option 1:** You are required to enter time in only hours format (ex. 12 NOT 12:00).After that you enter weekday, class name and what room it is in.

**Option 2:** You give two parameters, time again in hours only format and weekday.Program then proceeds to delete the class that has been set in that time in that weekday

**Option 3:** It wipes out the database

**Option 4:** It will print out in formated form the week calendar.

**Option 5:** Simply stops the program from running.
